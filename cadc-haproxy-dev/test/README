The haproxy.cfg in this directory can be use to test some haproxy configuration.
The backend goes to httpbin.org so the /headers path will return all the
headers that haproxy sends to the backend. When haproxy is invoked with user
certifactes, the certificate should appear as "X-Client-Certificate" header.
